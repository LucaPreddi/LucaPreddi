- :milky_way:  Hi, Iâ€™m Luca Predieri!
- :blue_heart:  Iâ€™m interested in software, robotics and music.
- :earth_americas:  Iâ€™m currently studying to get my master degree in robotics engineering at UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Genova, Italy. I graduated at Genoa in biomedical engineering with a thesis regarding the development of a videogame in Virtual Reality (using Unity 3D) which aims to discover cognitive problems in old patients.

Hey! In the last months I saw that some people used and published my code as their work! 
GitHub.com is for sure an open source platform where everybody can inspire to! Anyway, if you're republishing my work as yours I would be glad either to take credits either to be asked to use it. As you can see in this article, [The Legal Side of Open Source](https://opensource.guide/legal/) it is not so legal to copy and reuse the code of someone else, even if the repo is public. <br />
So, please, if you need help or my code, contact me!

ðŸ“·  In case you're asking yourself, yes I took the photos at the beginning!
